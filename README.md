# Laravel CRUD to Microservice Sample

## Enterprise-Grade CQRS + DDD Implementation

This project demonstrates the transformation of a basic Laravel CRUD application into an enterprise-grade microservice using **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** and **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)** patterns.

## Project Overview

### Phase 1: Basic CRUD ✅
- Laravel 12 project setup
- User model and migration
- RESTful API endpoints for user management
- Basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

### Phase 2: CQRS Architecture 🚧 (In Progress)
- Command pattern for write operations
- Query pattern for read operations
- Separate handlers for business logic
- Command/Query bus implementation

### Phase 3: DDD Structure 📋 (Planned)
- Domain layer with business entities
- Application layer with use cases
- Infrastructure layer with data persistence
- Clean separation of concerns

### Phase 4: Microservice Architecture 📋 (Planned)
- Service containerization
- API gateway patterns
- Event-driven communication
- Scalable deployment structure

## Enterprise Architecture Patterns Implemented

Based on 2024-2025 best practices research:

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- **Commands**: Handle write operations (CreateUser, UpdateUser, DeleteUser)
- **Queries**: Handle read operations (GetUser, ListUsers)
- **Handlers**: Process business logic for each command/query
- **Bus Pattern**: Centralized dispatching mechanism

### DDD (Domain-Driven Design)
- **Domain Layer**: Core business logic and entities
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and application services
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Data persistence and external integrations
- **Bounded Contexts**: Clear domain boundaries

### Clean Architecture Principles
- **Dependency Inversion**: Domain doesn't depend on infrastructure
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients depend only on interfaces they use

## API Endpoints

### Current Endpoints (Basic CRUD)
```
GET    /api/           - API information
GET    /api/users      - List all users
GET    /api/users/{id} - Get specific user
POST   /api/users      - Create new user
PUT    /api/users/{id} - Update user
DELETE /api/users/{id} - Delete user
```

### Request/Response Examples

#### Create User
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"John Doe","email":"john@example.com","password":"password123"}'
```

#### Response
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "User created successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "created_at": "2025-09-17T15:34:44.000000Z"
  }
}
```
